taking into account that all project related files are created manually (files of all projects, filters and properties in this solution),
there is some trick preventing to start a work with new project files in VS code explorer properly:
	!!! do not forget !!!! to specify required property page file name in project file, otherwise there is a lot of time will be spent for nothing;

*important*
in case when a reference path to external project is changed, reloading the project, for which the reference is changed, does not help to use that path in the code;

the only step to fix it is:
	deleting the folder .vs;
